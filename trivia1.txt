Jessica Weinburger Final term 2
Indexing
sports = "Basketball"/print(sports[3])/This will result in which of the following outputs:
1.B
2.s
3.k
4.t
3
s will be the output of index 3 as the first letter is 0 and you count up from there. 
Index Slicing
sports = "figure skating" / print(sports[7:]) / What is the output of this code?
1.skating
2.fig
3.skat
4.ing
1
skating will be the output, because indexing starts at 0. 
List
something = [ "basketball", "figure skating", "baseball", "softball" ] / print(something) / what is the output?
1.['basketball', 'figure skating', 'baseball', 'softball']
2.basketball, figure skating, baseball, softball
3.softball, baseball, figure skating, basketball
4.figure skating, basketball, baseball, softball
1
When printing a list the brackets still exist and so do the '. 
Appending
cur_values = [.25, .05, .01] / What is the correct way to append and print out this list?
1.cur_value.append() / print (cur_values)
2.cur_values.append(1) / print(cur_values)
3.cur_names.append(1) / print(cur_values)
4.cur_names.append() / print(cur_values)
2
2 is the correct method of append as the rest of them would result in a name error.
For in 
cities = ["Chicago", "New York", "San Fransisco"] / for city in cities: / print(city). What is the output?
1.Chicago / New York / San Fransisco
2.San Fransisco
3.New York
4.San Fransisco / New York / Chicago
1
Because the other 2 didn't cycle through the list and the last one printed backwards
Syntax Errors
Which one of these is a syntax error?
1.wrong output
2.indent
3.misspellings
4.can't find file
3
Misspellings are syntax errors because the compiler doesn't recognize it in the standard library
Reading Files
Which mode is to read and write?
1.r
2.r+
3.w
4.a
2
r+ reads and writes to the file. 
length
riddle = "What do you call two witches who live together? / print(len(riddle)) / what is the output of this?
1.47
2.25
3.50
4.46
1
There 47 characters in this riddle. 
Range
for i in range(4): / print(hello) / What is the output of this code?
1.hello / hello / hello / hello
2.hello / hello/ hello
3.hello, hello, hello, hello
4.hello, hello, hello,
1
This outputs the hello four times and it prints it on individual lines
.split()
what does .split() do?
1. it splits by commas
2. it splits by spaces
3. it splits by enter
4. it splits by quotes
2
As there is nothing within the .split() it will seperate by space
